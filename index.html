    <pre>
    The island is a mysterious survival table top rpg made by Quasar.
    As the name suggests the players are stuck on an island without any idea on how they got there, but it
 gets worse, our characters start to lose their memory even more as the time goes by. The island itself is 
 home for 4 different tribes of goblink-like creatures that differ not only by color but for their culture.
    Is any of those tribes the villain of the story? Is there really a hero? Why do the natives don't seem
 to suffer from any memory loss?
    As a player your mission is to get out of the island as quickly as possible, you have only 7 days until you do,
 or else...
    Time is a scarcity sure, but can you resist the temptation to understand what is happening on that island? Is there
 a treasure? A curse or a blessing? An ancient power waiting to be acquired? Can you stop the memory loss problem? After all
 the natives are living just fine, what would you do if the effect left you? Conquer the island for yourself, attract others
 onto your island so you can rule over zombie state humans completely oblivious to your intentions and powers?
    There are so many questions buried beneth the sand just waiting to be found.
    7 days.
    1. Quem sou eu?
    2. Como é minha família?
    3. Como são os meus amigos?
    4. Como é a minha casa?
    5. Onde eu moro? (cidade/estado/país)
    6. Para onde estava indo antes de parar na ilha?
    7. O que eu mais gosto de fazer?

    The red tribe is known for it's fighting skills and bloodthirsty acts, making them the scariest tribe in a one-on-one 
 or small group fighting scenarios. All the tribes believe that Red has war in their DNA, which means, don't underestimate
 them, not even their kids, if you find yourself alone with one of them run as fast as you can.
    Being able to manipulate blood and fire at will, always seeking for trouble this tribe proved to be the most dangerous one.

    The blue tribe is know for their calm nature. Always working in group and helping each other, more than just a tribe, they are
 family. Not goblin left behind and we can all walk side by side.
    Being able to manipulate water at will, the blue tribe doesn't have to concern themselfs on how to purify water for everyone,
 nor they're preocupied on how to get food since catching fish is a walk on the park.
    With high accuracy skills, Blues are often referred to as "Blue Hawks", they always hit their target, water, land or sky.

<pre id="greentext">
    Green are short, wise and tricky. The most knowledge filled tribe, always using their brains to no good, hard to trust
 and harder to understand. They tend to avoid fights at all costs, but they won't hesitate to leave traps everywhere, so
 remember to NEVER follow a Green.
    If they look scared is a trap, if they are smiling is trap, if they are sad is a trap, well you got the idea.
    Most of the books that end up on the island go straight to Green's camp, so if you really want to know something, you have
 to get their trust, doing that is a mystery in itself.

    Purple is the more diverse group, mostly because no one understand what is going on inside their tribe, or inside their
 heads to be honest. Also known as the moon tribe, Purples are a mystic tribe, they can unravel secrets hidden anywhere 
 almost as if they've planted themselfs.
    Usually come out at night, considered to be invincible by the moonlight and almost useless during the day, purple is
 inconsistent in every way, but this wild inconsistency works, no idea how, but it works.
