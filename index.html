    The island is a mysterious survival table top rpg made by Quasar.
    As the name suggests the players are stuck on an island without any idea on how they got there, but it
 gets worse, our characters start to lose their memory even more as the time goes by. The island itself is 
 home for 4 different tribes of goblink-like creatures that differ not only by color but for their culture.
    Is any of those tribes the villain of the story? Is there really a hero? Why do the natives don't seem
 to suffer from any memory loss?
    As a player your mission is to get out of the island as quickly as possible, you have only 7 days until you do,
 or else...
    Time is a scarcity sure, but can you resist the temptation to understand what is happening on that island? Is there
 a treasure? A curse or a blessing? An ancient power waiting to be acquired? Can you stop the memory loss problem? After all
 the natives are living just fine, what would you do if the effect left you? Conquer the island for yourself, attract others
 onto your island so you can rule over zombie state humans completely oblivious to your intentions and powers?
    There are so many questions buried beneth the sand just waiting to be found.
    7 days.
    1. Quem sou eu?
    2. Como é minha família?
    3. Como são os meus amigos?
    4. Como é a minha casa?
    5. Onde eu moro? (cidade/estado/país)
    6. Para onde estava indo antes de parar na ilha?
    7. O que eu mais gosto de fazer?
